# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot
This project involves the development of an autonomous obstacle-avoiding robot powered by the Arduino Uno microcontroller. The robot is engineered to navigate its environment intelligently by detecting and avoiding obstacles in real time, making it ideal for robotics learning, indoor navigation, and pathfinding demonstrations.

The system utilizes an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to constantly scan the robotâ€™s surroundings. As the robot moves forward, the ultrasonic sensor monitors the distance between the robot and any potential obstacle in its path.

When an obstacle is detected within a predefined threshold distance, the robot automatically halts. It then activates the servo motor to rotate the ultrasonic sensor, scanning both the left and right directions to evaluate which path is more clear. Based on the sensor readings, the Arduino makes a decision to turn in the direction with the most available space and resumes movement.
## Key features of this project include:
### Real-time obstacle detection using ultrasonic distance sensing
### Autonomous navigation and path selection
### Servo-assisted environmental scanning
### Microcontroller-based decision-making with Arduino Uno
### Simple, efficient design ideal for beginners and prototyping

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in robotics, automation, and embedded systems, and serves as a foundational platform for more advanced AI-based navigation systems and robotic applications.
